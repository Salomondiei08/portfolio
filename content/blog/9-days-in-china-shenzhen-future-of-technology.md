# 9 Days in China — What Shenzhen Taught Me About the Future of Technology and Building Things

*From cashless payments to drone deliveries, here’s why this trip completely changed my perspective.*

## Arrival — First impression: AI everywhere

I recently spent nine days traveling across China, moving between **Qingdao → Jinan → Guangzhou → Shenzhen**.

Each city was interesting in its own way.

But Shenzhen?

Shenzhen felt different.

The moment I walked out of the plane, the first thing I saw was an **AI advertisement inside the airport**.

Not luxury brands.
Not tourism ads.
AI.

It immediately set the tone.

This wasn’t just another big city — it felt like landing in a place designed for builders.

*The city’s skyline felt like a preview of the future.*

## Payments: the most frictionless system I’ve ever used

In most countries, you still think about:
- cash or card?
- Apple Pay or terminal?
- foreign fees?

In China, you don’t think at all.

You just scan.

WeChat Pay and Alipay work **literally everywhere**:
- street food vendors
- metro gates
- taxis
- convenience stores
- tiny local shops

I linked my foreign bank card once and didn’t touch cash for the entire trip.

Payments became invisible — which is exactly what good technology should feel like.

## Transportation that actually respects your time

China’s public transport is honestly world-class.

Especially in Shenzhen:
- a station is almost always within 5–10 minutes
- trains come every few minutes
- everything is clean, cheap, and reliable

Even intercity travel was smooth thanks to high-speed trains between cities.

It sounds simple, but when transportation “just works,” your whole experience of a city changes.

You spend time exploring — not waiting.

*Fast, clean, and always on time.*

## Electric city = quieter, cleaner, calmer

One thing I noticed immediately: the streets felt… quiet.

That’s because Shenzhen has:
- fully electric public buses
- most taxis electric
- tons of personal EVs

The result:
Less noise.
Better air.
More comfortable streets.

It genuinely felt healthier than many large cities I’ve visited.

*Calmer streets and cleaner air made the city feel more livable.*

## Huaqiangbei — the hardware builder’s playground

Then I discovered Huaqiangbei.

And honestly… it blew my mind.

Imagine:
- floors and floors of components
- sensors, chips, screens, batteries
- drones, cameras, modules
- every part you might ever need

If you’re building hardware or robotics, this place feels unreal.

You can:

prototype → source parts → negotiate → manufacture

All in the same day.
No months of shipping delays.
No endless middlemen.

Now I understand why companies like DJI, Huawei, and Tencent are based here.

The ecosystem makes speed possible.

*Hardware and AI are everywhere — even in everyday retail displays.*

## Everyday life feels futuristic

This is the part that surprised me most.

Some things that felt straight out of sci-fi:

- ordering food delivered by drone
- autonomous taxis operating on public roads
- robots and smart devices showcased in malls
- AI and hardware startups everywhere

It’s not demo tech.

It’s daily life.

Technology isn’t theoretical here — it’s deployed.

*Everyday life feels like a demo that already shipped.*

## Lifestyle & cost of living

Another surprise: it’s actually affordable.

- food is cheap and delicious
- transport costs almost nothing
- daily expenses are reasonable for a megacity

You can focus on building instead of surviving.

Which explains why there are so many founders and engineers around.

*Even the waterfront felt built for momentum.*

## Final thoughts — why this trip mattered to me

As someone working in AI and building products, this trip reframed something important:

Innovation isn’t just about ideas.

It’s about **infrastructure**.

China — and especially Shenzhen — has:
- frictionless payments
- efficient transport
- manufacturing at your doorstep
- rapid prototyping
- fast tech adoption

It’s a city optimized for execution.

And for builders, that’s everything.

I didn’t just visit Shenzhen.

I studied it.

And I’m definitely going back.
